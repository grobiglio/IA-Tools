  "description": "Cinematic sequence showing a small gray Scania truck with a silver metallic chassis and a custom logo on the chassis, driving from right to left across a grassy field. The truck stops at the center of the frame. The structure leaps out from inside the chassis and assembles progressively forward, covering the truck. The structure features exposed truss elements, colorful fabric panels (pink, aqua, yellow), and two large LED panels. Time-lapse style animation conveys the rapid yet realistic assembly process. The final view should show only the fully assembled, modern stage structure with visible truss architecture and a clean finish.",
