  "description": "A transparent SMEG kettle is placed onto a chrome gas stove set against a pure white studio backdrop. The stove remains fully visible throughout. As the kettle touches the burner, a quick squirt of red mist injects upward from the flame. The mist swirls inside the transparent body and gradually fills the form. As the red mist rises, the kettle seamlessly transitions into its iconic glossy red finish with chrome accents. The stove remains beneath, untouched, anchoring the shot in reality. Editorial, clean, and cinematic.",
